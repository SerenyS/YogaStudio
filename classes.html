            your eyes and breathe slowly but deeply. Sink into the mat and let your worries slip away.When you are
            ready,roll on your side and use your arms to push yourself to a sitting position with crossed legs. Place
            your hands in a prayer position. Be grateful for all that you have in life. Namaste."</p>
