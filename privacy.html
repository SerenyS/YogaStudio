        We use "cookies" on this site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on a site visitor's hard drive to help us
        improve
        your
        access to our site and identify repeat visitors to our site. For instance, when we use a cookie to identify you,
        you
        would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. Cookies can also
        enable
        us to
        track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. Usage of a cookie is in no
        way
        linked
        to any personally identifiable information on our site.

        Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access
        to
        or
        control over these cookies.

        <h3>Sharing</h3>
        We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any
        personal
        information that can identify any individual person.

        We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods
        and
        services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any
        secondary
        purposes beyond filling your order.
        <a id="6"></a>
        <h3>Security</h3>
        We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your
        information
        is protected both online and offline.

        Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and
        transmitted
        to
        us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https" at
        the
        beginning of the address of the Web page.

        While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information
        offline.
        Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are
        granted
        access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable
        information are kept in a secure environment.
